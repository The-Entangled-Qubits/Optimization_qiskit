# qiskit

Qiskit is an open source SDK for working with quantum computers at the level of pulses, circuits and algorithms. It accelerates the development of quantum applications by providing the complete set of tools needed for interacting with quantum systems and simulators.

In this Repository, I have tried out basic qiskit circuits and their optimization using transpiler.
